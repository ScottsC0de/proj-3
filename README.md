## Description

This application was created after one of the developers told a story about a fabulous vacation
that she had taken.  It was to the Hawaiian Islands.  She was fascinated by the beaches in 
particular. She stated that the Hawaiian Islands are home to some of the most beautiful beaches in the world, with crystal-clear water, soft white sand, and gentle waves. Each island has its own unique beaches, from the popular Waikiki Beach on Oahu to the secluded Lanikai Beach on the island of Kauai.  After the story the group concluded that they would love to see the pictures.  From that conversation, the topic of a final project of our web-development 
bootcamp came up, and it was unanimous that we should create a photo-sharing app using React and an api from flickr.  This app allows the user to view photos that inspire, entertain and delight the users imagination!  When the page loads, the user has the option of logging in or signing up if they are new.  Once they login or signup, they can view, search and like photos from other users in the application.  Enjoy the journey!
